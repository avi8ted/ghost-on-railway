# Ghost on Railway

This template deploys a self-hosted version of [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) on [Railway](https://railway.app/?referralCode=alphasec). Internally it uses a MySQL database to store the data. For a step-by-step guide, see [this](https://alphasec.io/how-to-set-up-your-own-blog-using-ghost-on-railway/) post, or click the button below.

## ✨ Features

- Ghost
- MySQL

## 💁‍♀️ How to use

- Click the Railway button 👆
- Add the environment variables
  - If you do not add the `CLOUDINARY_URL` environment variable, your images/files will not be persisted between deploys.
  - Add the `MAILGUN_SMTP_LOGIN` and `MAILGUN_SMTP_PASSWORD` variables if you want to invite users to your admin panel or send emails to your subscribers when you publish a new post.

## 📝 Notes

- Railway's filesystem is ephemeral which is why any changes to the filesystem are not persisted between deploys. This is why, this example uses Cloudinary for storage.
- The above limitation also affects the way themes work with Ghost, we use the `bin/themes.sh` script to copy over the themes every time you deploy. That way, the theme is always present.
  - To add a theme, first add the package as a dependency to the `package.json` file and then add it to the list of themes in the `bin/themes.sh` file.
  - Do NOT add a theme directly using the Ghost UI, it will look like it worked but will break whenever you deploy your app again.
