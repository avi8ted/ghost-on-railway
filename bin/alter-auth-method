  Ghost internally uses the `mysql` library which does not support the `caching_sha2_password`
  authentication method and hence does not work properly with MySQL 8.

  So we use this function to tell MySQL to authenticate our user using the
  `mysql_native_password` method by using the `mysql2` library which then allows Ghost to use
  our database with that same authentication method.
